#  Frontend Mentor -  Interactive-Pricing-Section

This is my solution to the [Interactive-Pricing features Challenge on Frontend Mentor].

* Note:there are so many ways to complete this challenge, so this is my own way of completing the challenge.

# Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers.
